        At Pawana Camping, we value the trust you place in us when booking your camping
        experience. To ensure the smooth operation of our services and maintain the exceptional quality we offer,
        the following policy applies:
    </p>

            reason for cancellation.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Rescheduling Within the Same Week:</strong> If unforeseen circumstances prevent you from attending, we'll do our best
            to accommodate rescheduling or customizing your visit within the same week of your original booking. This
            flexibility is offered as a goodwill gesture to help you still enjoy your Pawana Camping experience.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Why This Policy is Important:</strong> Managing resources and planning activities requires significant effort, and
